# New York City Leading Causes of Death Visualization

This 3D data visualization is my experiment representing data charts in 3D. The size of the spheres represents the amount of deaths for each cause and the color referes to gender. I mapped death causes index, year and race to xyz axies . Still WIP. 

Here is the [demo](http://www.qianqian-ye.com/nyc-death-cause-viz/).
